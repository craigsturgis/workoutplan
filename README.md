# Craig's Workout Plan

## What it's for
I am creating this little tool as a simple little project to accomplish a few things:

1.	Have something I can bookmark on a computer or a phone that at a glance tells me what I need to run today while training for a race. For some reason I haven't found anything like this that works the way my brain does.
2.	Provide an excuse to tinker with some front end javascript technologies I haven't gotten to play with.
3.	Force myself to learn some front end things I'm not as familiar with like building a responsive page from the ground up, less/scss, web fonts, etc.

## Initial vision

*	Define a training plan for an event like a half marathon, etc.
*	Develop a standard JSON format for that training plan
*	Allow for a race / event date to be inputted
*	Store that race date in a cookie / local storage and use it to work backwards and calculate what workout to do for today, and preview upcoming workouts on demand
*	No web service back end or anything, purely "baked" HTML, JS, CSS

### Potential future vision

*	Multiple training plans and selecting from them
*	Easier creation of training plan data than manual JSON file creation
*	The future, Conan?
*	Other ideas ok.
